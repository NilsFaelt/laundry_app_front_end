# Laundry_booking_system

A system fro booking laundry, intern email, forum and so on,  built as my final project in school. 

### Important !
Since the server running on a free tier, there will be a 30s start up time, so when you get a message warning that ypu couldnt loggin, just wait 30s and try again.

## To run 
The lazy way 
[Click me](https://laundryapp-front-end.onrender.com/)

Otherwise:
* Git clone project to folder of choice
* run cmd: npm i || yarn i 
* start: npm start
* Since th server running on a free tier, there will be a 30s delay before it starts running, dont give up hope.
### Loggin
